JackDAV
=======

JackDAV is a WebDAV server implementation for [Jack](http://jackjs.org/), based on [RackDAV](http://www.matthias-georgi.de/2009/4/rackdav-web-authoring-for-rack).

JackDAV is a work in progress and is not currently functional.

OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE are implemented (mostly)
